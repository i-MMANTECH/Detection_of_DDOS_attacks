This repository is dedicated to the detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques implemented in Python. It aims to provide a robust framework for identifying and mitigating DDoS attacks, which are a prevalent threat in cybersecurity.

Key Features:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collection of datasets containing normal and DDoS traffic.
Preprocessing steps including data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
Feature Extraction:

Extraction of relevant features from network traffic data that are indicative of DDoS attacks.
Use of statistical and heuristic methods to identify critical features.
Machine Learning Models:

Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks.
Training and tuning of models to achieve optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Comprehensive evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Cross-validation techniques to ensure the robustness of the models.
Attack Detection and Mitigation:

Real-time detection of DDoS attacks using trained models.
Strategies for mitigating detected attacks and reducing false positives.
Visualization:

Visualization of network traffic data and model performance.
Graphs and charts to represent attack patterns and detection results.
